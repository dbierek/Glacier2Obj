`glacier2obj` provides functionality to search for mesh (PRIM) files with a Glacier scene from the Hitman games. Eventually it will also convert them into an OBJ file.

## Features

- Read from Glacier scene files and search for PRIM files using [`rpkg-rs`](https://github.com/dafitius/rpkg-rs)

## Future Plans

- Convert all PRIMs to a single OBJ file for use with [`recastnavigation-glacier`](https://github.com/dbierek/recastnavigation-glacier).

## Contributions
Bug reports, PRs and feature requests are welcome.
